 <p> In this sequel to the popular Korean sci-fi action thriller The Witch, </p> 
 <p> the story moves away from a confined secret lab and out into the real world. </p> 
 <p> After a mysterious girl emerges as the sole survivor of a bloody raid on the research </p>
 <p> facility called the Ark behind the top-secret Witch Program, she is rescued by a pair of </p>
 <p> civilians, Siblings Kyung-hee (Park Eun-bin) and Dae-gi (Sung Yoo-bin), who soon realize the </p> 
 <p> girl is both very powerful and in very grave danger. However, as the assassins tasked with </p> 
 <p> locating and silencing the girl move ever closer, the lives of everyone balance on a razor’s edge.</p>
 <p> The first act of the film ramps up slowly. It sets the stage by bringing the story of the Witch Program </p>
 <p> back “many years” and introducing a new girl with a past that is shrouded in secrecy by deeply connected </p>
 <p> to Ja-Yoon (Kim Da-Mi). Cloning, assassination, lots of blood, The Witch 2 is centered around the girl </p> 
 <p> that brings multiple agencies with different motives together in a final act. In a lot of ways, the film </p>
 <p> is best explained as a violent superpowered fight fest with some story thrown in. In fact, unlike the first </p> 
 <p> film, much of the violence in the film doesn’t always push the narrative forward. Instead, they pop up like </p>
 <p> gems of brutality.</p>
